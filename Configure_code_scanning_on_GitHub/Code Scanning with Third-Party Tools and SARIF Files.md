# Guide to Code Scanning with Third-Party Tools and SARIF Files 🔍🛠️

GitHub allows you to run code scanning either **inside GitHub** or by **uploading results** from other tools. This helps find bugs and security issues early.

---

## What is SARIF? 📄

- SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format) files store the results of code scans.
- Many tools, including GitHub’s own CodeQL, can create SARIF files.
- SARIF version **2.1.0** is supported by GitHub.
- Uploading SARIF files lets you see scanning alerts directly on GitHub.

## How to Upload SARIF Files ✉️

You can upload SARIF results in different ways:

### 1. Using GitHub’s Code-Scanning API

- Automate uploading and retrieving code scan alerts.
- Data is sent and received as JSON.
- Use media type `application/sarif+json` for uploads.

Example of listing alerts with cURL:

curl -L 
-H “Accept: application/vnd.github+json” 
-H “Authorization: Bearer ” 
-H “X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28” 
https://api.github.com/orgs/ORG/code-scanning/alerts

### 2. Using CodeQL CLI 🛠️

- A free tool that analyzes code and creates SARIF files.
- Works on public repos for free; requires Advanced Security license for private repos.
- Download the CodeQL bundle, which includes the CLI and queries.
- Upload results to GitHub after analysis.

---

### 3. Using GitHub Actions Workflow ⚙️

- Automate SARIF upload in your repository with GitHub Actions.
- Workflows use `.yml` files stored in `.github/workflows/`.
- Use the `upload-sarif` GitHub Action to upload your SARIF files.


Example ESLint analysis workflow that generates and uploads a SARIF file:

## Important Notes ❗

- GitHub uses **fingerprints** in SARIF files to avoid duplicate alerts.
- If fingerprints are missing, the upload action will try to create them.
- Uploads can include up to **5,000 results** and must be under **10 MB** compressed.
- If your SARIF files are too large, configure your tools to focus on the most important issues.

Using SARIF files and third-party tools with GitHub helps you keep your code secure and high-quality automatically! 🚀🔒
